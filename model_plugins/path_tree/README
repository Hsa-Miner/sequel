# A Path Tree that stores the path for each element, making it able to retrieve
# all children (including indirect) with one query while being more flexible
# and easier than a nested set.
#
# == Usage ==
# +is :path_tree, {}+
# Please don't forget the empty hash, it's needed with the current sequel.
# When you apply the plugin with an empty option hash, a default path column
# named 'path' is created if not present, using a default delimiter of '.'
#
# TODO Document customization options
