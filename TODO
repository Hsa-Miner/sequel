* Refactor schema code to allow adapters to adapt schema definitions to specific capabilities.

* Refactor Dataset and descendants for DRY. Methods like count, select etc. should be defined in Sequel::Dataset.

* Rename Dataset's record_class attributes to model_class.

* many_to_many smart relationships.

* schema extraction and database dumping and copying.

* Improve relationship DSL To allow stuff like the following:

class Book
  one_to_one author, :class => Author
end

Book.filter_by_author(Author[:name => 'Kurt Vonnegut']).print

#instead of:

Book.filter_by_author_id(Author[:name => 'Kurt Vonnegut'].id).print

* The first open Database should be assigned as Model.db.
